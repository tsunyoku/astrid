# astrid

if you'd like to test a running instance of astrid (python), you can devserver onto `test.iteki.pw` using your Iteki credentials.

astrid uses pre-commit hooks, meaning every commit goes through multiple checks before being able to push. i recommend for anyone who intends to modify their own version of astrid utilises this as it helps to trail out any bugs or bad quality code! if you need a further explanation of pre-commit and what it does, i recommend you check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psjz6rwzMdk)
