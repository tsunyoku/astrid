# astrid

astrid is a multi-branch osu! server project with the idea of being created in as many different languages as possible. each language will have it's own branch and they will all follow the same feature-set, database structure etc. in their respective language. this project is a large WIP and first will only contain python and c# but the language-scope should expand.

to clone in your respective language:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsunyoku/astrid --branch <language>
```

specific setup instructions will be provided in a readme on their respective branch

astrid focuses on a few things:

- speed
- efficiency
- quality code
- high feature set

my style can highly differ from others, as someone who falls around multiple languages all the time i have some weird ideas of what seems "clean" to other people it seems...
i really don't give a fuck, as long as i meet the 3 targets above then people don't have to like my style as long as the code is high quality.
