# astrid

entire backend emulator for osu! private servers.
this project is private, so if you are seeing this then you are pretty cool.

astrid focuses on a few things:

- speed
- efficiency
- quality code
- high feature set

my style can highly differ from others, as someone who falls around multiple languages all the time i have some weird ideas of what seems "clean" to other people it seems...
i really don't give a fuck, as long as i meet the 3 targets above then people don't have to like my style as long as the code is high quality.
